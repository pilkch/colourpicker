### What is this?

This is just a colour picker written in javascript, but it also has 3 other colour pickers that show a basic simulation of what a colour blind person might see.  

The four colour pickers available are:  
RGB  
RGB Protanope - Reds are greatly reduced (1% of men)  
RGB Deuteranope - Greens are greatly reduced (1% of men)  
RGB Tritanope - Blues are greatly reduced (0.003% of the population)
